## Getting Started (with Expo)
If you are using Expo Cli, clone the repo and run "expo start" in the root folder of the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/izqalan/Gatekeeper.git
cd react-native-firebase
npm install
expo start
```

## Getting Started (without Expo)
If you prefer using React Native CLI, you'll need to eject from Expo first:
```
git clone https://github.com/instamobile/react-native-firebase.git
cd react-native-firebase
expo eject
npm install
react-native run-android // react-native run-ios
```
This React Native Firebase starter ([e2c3b6098d Tree](https://github.com/izqalan/Gatekeeper/tree/e2c3b6098dffae79b3c30178458a9540bc37a786)) is built with Firebase Web SDK, which makes it compatible with both Expo CLI and React Native CLI.
